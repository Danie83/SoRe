      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        SoRe (Social Recommender) is a Web modular system able to recommend certain items of interest (people, events, places, other things) according to a given knowledge graph expressed in RDF and automatically built for a specific user - for example, based on her/his social media profile(s) - by considering multiple similar features/properties. For instance, suggesting the members of an IT team based on desired skills (excellent knowledge of certain areas like Web technologies + open hardware), geographic location (i.e. from Romania and Chile only), technical preferences (e.g., using free software), background info (demographics, education, occupation history, driving license, other competencies), hobbies (i.e. horror movies + classical music), aversions (e.g., communication by phone, sport, politics) and so on. The system should be “smart” enough to improve recommendations based on various methods such as user feedback, reasoning, and/or machine learning. The recommended items will be available via a SPARQL endpoint.
      </p>

    <section id="requirements">
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>These following requirements form a foundation for developing and evaluating the web modular system. Each requirement should be testable and measurable to ensure that the system meets the specified criteria.</p>
        <section id="functional">
            <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
            <h4>User Profile Creation</h4>
            <p>The system should allow users to create and update their profiles. This involves user registration by either creating an account or logging using their Google account, in this case some of the information can be acquired beforehand.</p>
            <h4>Knowledge Graph Construction</h4>
            <p>The system must automatically build a knowledge graph for each user based on the imported data, representing relationships between the user and various items of interest.</p>
            <h4>Recommendation Generation</h4>
            <p>the system should generate personalized recommendations for users based on their knowledge graphs, considering features such as skills, geographic location, technical preferences, background information, hobbies , and aversions.</p>
            <h4>User Feedback Mechanism</h4>
            <p>Users should be able to provide feedback on the recommendations received, influencing the system's future recommendations.</p>
            <h4>SPARQL Endpoint Access</h4>
            <p>The system must expose a SPARQL endpoint through which users can query and retrieve their personalized recommendations.</p>
            <h4>Continuous Improvement</h4>
            <p>The system should incorporate machine learning algorithms to continuously improve recommendation accuracy based on user interactions and feedback.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="non-functional">
            <h3>Non-functional Requirements</h3>
            <h4>Performance</h4>
            <p>The system should respond to user queries within a reasonable time frame (e.g. under 3 seconds) to ensure a responsive user experience.</p>
            <h4>Scalability</h4>
            <p>The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and an expanding knowledge graph without a significant degradation in performance.</p>
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>User data, especially sensitive information obtained from social media profiles, must be securely stored and transmitted. The system should implement encryption and access controls.</p>
            <h4>Reliability</h4>
            <p>The system should be available for use 99.9% of the time, minimizing downtime for maintenance or unexpected issues.</p>
            <h4>User privacy</h4>
            <p>The system must adhere to privacy regulations and ensure that the user data is handled responsibly. Users should have control over the information shared and used for recommendations.</p>
            <h4>Adaptability</h4>
            <p>The system should be compatible with a variety of devices and browsers to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>
            <h4>Maintability</h4>
            <p>The system should be designed with a modular and maintainable code to facilitate updates, bug fixes, and future enhancements.</p>
            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <p>Comprehensive documentation should be provided for developers, system administrators, and end-users to understand the system's functionality, configuration, and usage.</p>
            <h4>Deployment</h4>
            <p>The application will be deployed using Amazon Web Services, in which the performance, scalability, security, reliability, user privacy, adaptability and maintability will be provided to all users and can be monitored at all times.</p>

            <h3>Databases</h3>
            <p>User Database (Django): A PostgreSQL database that stores user authentication and registration information.</p>
            <p>Knowledge graph Database (Neo4j): Stores RDF-based knowledge graphs representing relationships between users and items of interest.</p>
            
            <h3>RDF Representation of Knowledge Graph</h3>
            <p>Format: Utilizes RDF (Resource Description Framework) to represent the knowledge graph.</p>
            <p>Structure: Nodes represent entities (e.g., users, events, places) and edges represent relationships between entities.</p>
            <p>Ontology: Defines a set of terms and their relationships, providing a standardized way to represent information.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>User Registration Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When a user registers, the Django application collects basic information and initiates the process.</li>
                <li>The Flask application accesses the Neo4j database to retrieve the user's knowledge graph.</li>
                <li>Using a recommendation algorithm, the Flask application generates personalized recommendations based on the user's profile and knowledge graph.</li>
                <li>The recommendations are sent back to the Django application for display to the user.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Recommendation Generation Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The Django application, upon receiving a user request for recommendations, sends a request to the Flask Recommendation API.</li>
                <li>The Flask application accesses the Neo4j database to retrieve the user's knowledge graph.</li>
                <li>Using a recommendation algorithm, the Flask application generates personalized recommendations based on the user's profile and knowledge graph.</li>
                <li>The recommendations are sent back to the Django application for display to the user.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Profile Update Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When a user updates their profile through the Django interface, the Django application sends a request to the Flask Profile Update API.</li>
                <li>The Flask application updates the user's information in the user database and, if applicable, updates the knowledge graph in the Neo4J database.</li>
            </ol>

        </section>
            <p>
                The RDF Knowledge Graph is automatically built after a user registers and provides initial information to create the user node in the Neo4j knowledge graph. If the user chooses to use it's personal Google account, the initial information available is enough to provide the most basic knowledge graph. Any data that the user provides is integrated into the existing knowledge graph, enriching the user's profile.
                As the user interacts with the system and provides feedback, the knowledge graph is continuously updated to reflect the user's evolving preferences and interests. Machine learning algorithms may be employed to improve the accuracy of recommendations based on user feedback.
                The architecture ensures a separation of concerns, with Django handling user interactions and authentication and Flask managing recommendation generation and profile updates. the Neo4j database serves as the central repository for the RDF knowledge graph, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of complex relationships. The use of RDF allows for a flexible and standardized representation of information, supporting the system's goal of providing personalized recommendations based on a rich knowledge graph.

    <section id="recommendation-engine">
        <h2>Recommendation Engine</h2>
        <p>Content-Based Filtering will be used to recommend items to users based on the characteristics of the items and the user's profile data. The items are described using schemas, either public or custom, and are based on the input data provided by the user. The system will build a profile for each user based on their preferences for different features selected, this profile is then used to recommend items that match the user's preferences.</p>

        <h2>User Profile Creation</h2>
        <p>A user can either register with a new account or connect using its Google account, the only difference is the level of information that is initially provided by the two. In the first scenario, there is no information available and the user will need to complete a registration form to access all the application functionalities. In the second scenario, the application uses the available information from the Google Platform. In both cases, information can be added or updated through a form.</p>

        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <p>The Django application provides by default User forms and security when it comes to account security, this is additionally enforced by using a separate database for users, their data being stored in a different database.</p>
        <p>Communication between the Django application and the Flask APIs are encrypted using the private and public key system.</p>

        <h2>Scalability and Performance</h2>
        <p>Amazon Web Services provides an auto scaling service which monitors your applications and automatically
            adjusts the capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Auto Scaling can
            be easily setup for multiple resources across multiple services (Django and Flask applications). It also provides
            an user interface where scaling plans for Amazon EC2 instances can be built. The main components of the application
            will be deployed using Amazon EC2 instances and will be dynamically scales in ordeer to optimize performance, costs or
            maintain a balance between them.

        <h2>Testing and Quality Assurance</h2>
        <p>The Django framework offers an in-built support for testing functionalities, this can be used to test the endpoints and
            the functionalities. Tests can be performed to identify hotspots and limitations in performance of the application
            and create an AWS optimal configuration. The API will be tested mainly using Django, but <b>pytest</b> package will
            also be used for tests related to the recommendation endpoints because the algorithm will be a separate module
            that can't be accessed outside of the Django application.

        <h2>Deployment and Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Deployment will be done using Amazon Web Services. The component applications will be deployed on EC2 instances which will
            be configured with the necessary resources based on the performance tests. According to the monitoring system provided by
            AWS, it is possible to maintain the applications within reasonable thresholds and provide a smooth user experience. AWS 
            also provides the ability to set alerts which can be triggered by unepected events. In this case, a properly setup alert
            can notify the system owner in a timely manner and the situation can be dealt accordingly.
