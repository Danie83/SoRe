        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Recommender systems play an increasingly important role in the success of social media websites; Higher portions of 
            social websites traffic are triggered by recommendations and those sites rely on the quality of the recommendations 
            to attract new users and retain existing ones. <br> In this report, we propose a Web application specification of a social recommender system which stores RDF data.
            After a short introduction, we discuss in detail the functional requirements the application should implement, the system architecture, the user flow 
            and the user interface. In the last part, we mention and argument the security considerations we have to take into account, the scalability and performance by-passes techniques and
            the deployment and future maintenance. <br>
            We conclude with summarizing the most important parts of the entire report, argumenting the development process and why the addressed concerns are solved using the proposed implementation.  
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            SoRe (Social Recommender) is a Web modular system able to recommend certain connections according to a
            built-in knowledge graph
            expressed in RDF and automatically built for a specific user, based on her/his social media profile(s) and
            by considering multiple
            similar features/properties: skills (excellent knowledge of certain areas like Web technologies + open
            hardware), geographic location
            (i.e. from Romania and Chile only), technical preferences (e.g., using free software), background info
            (demographics, education,
            occupation history, driving license, other competencies), hobbies (i.e. horror movies + classical music),
            aversions (e.g.,
            communication by phone, sport, politics), acquaintance and so on. The system should be “smart” enough to
            improve recommendations based on various
            methods such as user feedback, reasoning, and/or machine learning. The recommended items will be available
            via a SPARQL endpoint.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="requirements">
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>These following requirements form a foundation for developing and evaluating the web modular system. Each
            requirement should be testable and measurable to ensure the system meets the specified criteria.</p>
        <section id="functional">
            <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
            <h4>User Profile Creation</h4>
            <p>The system should allow users to create and update their profiles. This involves user registration by
                creating an account in which various information about the user can be added. </p>
            <h4>Knowledge Graph Construction</h4>
            <p>The system must automatically build a knowledge graph for each user based on the imported data,
                representing relationships between the user and various items/other users of interest.</p>
            <h4>Recommendation Generation</h4>
            <p>The system should generate personalized recommendations for users, based on their knowledge graphs,
                considering features such as skills, geographic location, technical preferences, background information,
                hobbies, acquintaces and aversions.</p>
            <h4>User Feedback Mechanism</h4>
            <p>Users should be able to provide feedback on received recommendations, influencing the future
                recommendations of the system, taking into account liked and disliked users which a user has evaluated in the past. </p>
            <h4>SPARQL Endpoint Access</h4>
            <p>The system must expose a SPARQL endpoint through which users can query and retrieve their personalized
                recommendations.</p>
            <h4>Continuous Improvement</h4>
            <p>The system should incorporate machine learning algorithms to continuously improve the recommendation internal metric
                based on user interactions and feedback.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="non-functional">
            <h3>Non-functional Requirements</h3>
            <h4>Performance</h4>
            <p>The system should respond to user queries within a reasonable time frame (under 3 seconds) to ensure a
                responsive user experience.</p>
            <h4>Scalability</h4>
            <p>The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and an expanding knowledge graph without a
                significant degradation in performance.</p>
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>User data, especially sensitive information obtained from social media profiles, must be securely stored
                and sent. The system should implement encryption and access controls.</p>
            <h4>Reliability</h4>
            <p>The system should be available for use 99.9% of the time, minimizing downtime for maintenance or
                unexpected issues.</p>
            <h4>User privacy</h4>
            <p>The system must adhere to privacy regulations and ensure the user data is handled responsibly. Users
                should have control over the shared and used information for recommendations.</p>
            <h4>Adaptability</h4>
            <p>The system should be compatible with a variety of devices and browsers to ensure a seamless user
                experience.</p>
            <h4>Maintainability</h4>
            <p>The system should be designed with a modular and maintainable code to facilitate updates, bug fixes, and
                future enhancements.</p>

        </section>
        <p>
            The RDF Knowledge Graph is automatically built after a user registers and provides initial information to
            create the user node in the Fuseki Server knowledge graph. <br> 
            As the user interacts with the system and provides feedback, the knowledge graph is continuously updated to
            reflect the user's evolving preferences and interests. Machine learning approaches were employed to
            improve the internal metrics of recommendations based on user feedback. <br>
            The architecture ensures a separation of concerns, with Django handling user interactions, authentication, 
            managing recommendation generation and profile updates. The Fuseki Server is the central
            repository for the RDF knowledge graph, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of complex relationships.
            The use of RDF allows for a flexible and standardized representation of information, supporting the goal of the system of 
            providing personalized recommendations based on rich knowledge graphs.

        <p>This RDF knowledge graph structure provides a flexible and extensible representation of a user's social media
            knowledge, capturing a wide range of information and relationships for generating personalized
            recommendations. Each node corresponds to a specific aspect of the user's profile, allowing for detailed and
            context-rich recommendations.</p>

    <section id="recommendation-engine">
        <h2>Recommendation Engine</h2>
        <p>A similarity score will be used to recommend items to users based on the characteristics of the items
            and the user profile data. The items are described using schemas and are based
            on the input data provided by the user. The system will build a profile for each user based on their
            preferences for different features selected, this profile is then used to recommend items that match the
            user preferences.</p>

        <h2>User Profile Creation</h2>
        <p>A user can either register with a new account; there is no information
            available and the user will need to complete a registration form to access all the application
            functionalities. </p>

    <section id="sparql-endpoint">
        <h2>SPARQL Endpoint</h2>
        <p>It is the web service used to query and retrieve data from the resource that exposes the RDF data (the Fuseki Server) 
            using the SPARQL query language and protocol specifically designed for querying RDF data. The
            queries sent to the endpoint will be executed against the RDF data it manages, returning results to the
            Django application which will process them before returning the results to the user.</p>

                    have an account, to register. The functionalities of the application are not available to users that
                    are not logged in.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><i>User Profile form page</i>: This page is automatically displayed to newly registered users to add
                    necessary data about themselves which is then used to recommend other user profiles. It also acts as
                    a page for editing existing information about the user.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><i>Homepage</i>: The main page where the user can rate recommended user profiles, it will also display
                    recommended items based on the rating that was accorded.</p>

    <section id="security-considerations">
        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <p>The Django application provides by default user forms and security when it comes to account security; this is
            additionally enforced by using a separate database for users, their data being stored in a different
            database.</p>
        <p>Communication between the Django application and the Flask APIs are encrypted using the private and public
            key system.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="testing-and-quality-assurance">
        <h2>Testing and Quality Assurance</h2>
        <p>The Django framework offers an in-built support for testing functionalities, this can be used to test the
            endpoints and
            the functionalities. Tests can be performed to identify hotspots and limitations in performance of the
            application
            and create an AWS optimal configuration. The API will be tested mainly using Django, but <b>pytest</b>
            package will
            also be used for tests related to the recommendation endpoints because the algorithm will be a separate
            module
            that can't be accessed outside of the Django application.
        </p>
        <p> As it comes to RDF data validation, SHACL constraints will be used in order to validate the input data. </p>

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Use machine learning algorithms - ASL - in order to train a recommendation agent in order to predict similar users; </li>
            <li> Use Google Cloud services/Amazon EC2 instances in order to assure the system's scalability and reliability. </li>
            <li> Develop a stronger and much complex ontology for storing user information. </li>
